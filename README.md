# OSM
I will places notes on my discovery from all the touched work i have used from osm. I am not an expert on OSM i am just sharing what i discover. You can help but telling me whats wrong or how to improve on what i have shared. I set this up due to my lack of documentation of all the information i required in this field. I wish to share with the beginners my finding and understanding.
