I had some trouble installing Postgresql/Postgis on my virtual ubuntu. I research around and found out the osm site have the
best way to install both at the same time on ubuntu. The website is as follows:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PostGIS/Installation#Ubuntu_14.04_LTS

It uses this command:
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgis postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.1

This works perfectly as i require Postgis to allow my database to import the require geospatial data.
